export const DOCUMENT_TEXT = `Project Instructions: Adaptyv Nipah Virus Protein Design Competition
This document outlines the instructions for a project focused on participating in the Adaptyv-sponsored protein design competition to develop a protein capable of neutralizing the Nipah virus. The goal is to submit one or more computationally designed proteins for experimental validation.
I. Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design and submit a novel protein that binds to the Nipah virus Glycoprotein G (PDB: 8XPY) with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its ability to infect human cells. The project will leverage computational protein design tools and AI models to generate promising candidates. A secondary objective is to have at least one of our submitted designs selected for experimental validation by Adaptyv.
II. Key Project Milestones and Timeline
Project Kick-off and Team Formation: Week of October 20, 2025
Research and Strategy Finalization: By October 27, 2025
Design Sprints and Computational Modeling: October 27 - November 17, 2025
Candidate Selection and Finalization: November 18 - November 21, 2025
Submission Package Preparation: November 22 - November 23, 2025
Submission Deadline: November 24, 2025
Experimental Validation Period (by Adaptyv): December 1, 2025 - January 6, 2026
Results Analysis and Project Debrief: January 2026
III. Models and Computational Approaches
The project will explore a variety of computational protein design methods. The specific models and approaches to be utilized will be determined during the research phase but are expected to include a combination of:
De Novo Design: Designing a protein from scratch. This could involve using models like RFdiffusion or other generative models.
Lead Optimization: Improving upon existing protein scaffolds or known binders.
AI-powered platforms: Exploration of platforms such as Cradle, which has shown success in previous Adaptyv competitions[1][2].
Structure Prediction and Validation: Tools like AlphaFold2 will be used to predict the structure of our designs and to calculate metrics such as ipSAE (interface Predicted Aligned Error), which is a key selection criterion[3].
A curated list of popular AI models and design methods can be found at the link provided in the competition announcement.
IV. Specific Knowledge and Resources
This project will require knowledge in the areas of protein engineering, computational biology, and machine learning. Key resources for this project include:
Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G (PDB: 8XPY): The target protein structure. All designs must be created to bind to this target.
Proteinbase Competition Page: This is the central hub for all competition details, including submission guidelines and updates[3].
Adaptyv Bio's Platform: While direct use of their platform for this competition is for submission and results, understanding their past competitions and methodologies will be beneficial[4][5].
Relevant Scientific Literature: Research on Nipah virus, its entry mechanism, and existing attempts at inhibitor design will be crucial[6].
V. Submission Instructions
All protein designs must be submitted through the Proteinbase competition page. The submission period is from Monday, October 27, 2025, to November 24, 2025.
Each submission should include:
The amino acid sequence of the designed protein.
A PDB file of the predicted structure of the protein in complex with the Nipah virus Glycoprotein G.
Any additional data or methodology description as required by the submission portal.
A total of 1,000 designs will be selected for synthesis and testing based on three criteria: 600 by ipSAE score, 200 by an expert panel, and 200 by community vote. Therefore, designs should be optimized for a low ipSAE score.
VI. Style and Formatting of Deliverables
All internal documentation, including research notes, model outputs, and design rationales, will be maintained in a shared project repository. The final submission will adhere strictly to the format specified on the Proteinbase platform. The project will culminate in a final report summarizing the design process, the results (if our designs are selected), and key learnings.
